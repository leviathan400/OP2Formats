//! Finding real game data from tests. The data can't be committed, so a test that needs it passes without checking
//! anything when it's missing, and says so on stderr. With `OP2_REQUIRE_DATA=1` a missing install fails the test
//! instead, so a green run proves the real-data tests actually ran. The harness's recorded runs of the original are a
//! separate requirement, `OP2_REQUIRE_RUNS=1`: only a checkout with the harness has them, and a contributor without
//! one can still require the game data. Replaying a run needs the install too, so `OP2_REQUIRE_RUNS=1` also fails a
//! missing install.
